# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Risk-Scoring-System
This project predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave a service) using real telecom customer data. The model provides churn probability, risk level, and recommended business action to help companies retain customers proactively.


Customer retention is critical for telecom and subscription-based companies.
The goal is to identify high-risk customers before they leave and take preventive actions.
